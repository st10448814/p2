        <h1> We are</h1>
        <p>A group of Sneaker Lovers trying to bring the freshest style of threads to the people from every corner of the world.
            That is evident in our extensive range of designs that we offer. I started this business in 2019 but due to the Covid-19 Pandemic unfortunately
            I had to pause business. On the festive seasons Ghosty Fits had an influx of customers due to the people around me helping me to
            advertise. After hard work it started running fully as a franchise to more sneaker shops that I'm gonna be opening up in the near future.
            In 2023 we started running on a regular basis, even opening our own shop in the Savannah Mall which has increased sales. We noticed that our shop
            has been mentioned across social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, etc. So we decided to start our own website and since we didn't have an IT personell
            We had to wait until 2025 to launch our very own website. This will provide customers with insights on prices, discounts and specials with the option to order
            online, which has been our mission since day one. I am Selete Peter Molepo Owner and CEO of Ghosty Fits, along side my loyal salesperson Jake Tyrone Johnson and
            IT specialist Japhta Rhythm Maine. Our vision is to own a global-wide sneaker shop which can all be found around the whole
